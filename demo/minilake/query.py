"""The query interface. Part of minilake, an independent demonstration system written only from this
repository's write-up; not the platform's code.

fetch(lake, table, universe, from_, to, freq=None, snapshot=None, gaps=None, permit_future=False)
  - pins a snapshot (the latest version when none is named) and returns its number, so the same
    call can be repeated later on the same rows;
  - opens only the days in range (partition pruning), and only files that list a requested symbol;
  - raises rather than return an empty or silently partial result: an unknown symbol, a calendar
    day the snapshot does not hold (unless on_missing="skip", which names the days skipped), or an
    unknown snapshot;
  - never returns anything from at or after `to`. The read path hands over whole day partitions,
    later rows included, and as_of_guard() is the one place those rows are withheld. Gap handling
    that looks only backwards (gaps="carry_back") is allowed; gaps="closest" may look forwards and
    needs permit_future=True. Every filled bar says it was filled, and from which bar.
`to` is exclusive when it is a time, and covers the whole day when it is a date.
