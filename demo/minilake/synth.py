"""A SYNTHETIC tick delivery with planted problems. Part of minilake, an independent demonstration
system written only from this repository's write-up; not the platform's code. Nothing here is
market data.

Planted, and each must be found by the later layers exactly as often as it was planted:
  exact_duplicate  trade rows delivered twice, byte for byte, on the second day
  out_of_hours     one trade printed in the evening of the first day
  off_band_price   one trade at half the price of the trade before it
  crossed_quote    one quote whose bid is above its ask
  utc_stamp        a few trades stamped in UTC (with a +00:00 offset) instead of exchange time,
                   a value cleansing corrects
  missing_day      one calendar day with no delivery at all
Closing-auction trades, stamped a fraction after 15:00:00, are planted as well (one per symbol per
day, their trade_id ending "-auction"). They are not a problem: they must be labelled, never dropped.
