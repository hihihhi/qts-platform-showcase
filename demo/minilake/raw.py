"""Layer 1, raw: delivered files kept byte for byte under a SHA-256 manifest. Part of minilake, an
independent demonstration system written only from this repository's write-up; not the platform's
code.

A file enters once and is made read-only. Re-delivering the same bytes is a no-op; different bytes
under a name already held are refused, because the raw layer is never rewritten. verify() reports
any held file whose bytes no longer match the manifest.
