"""Concurrent readers, writers and a rewriter on one table, each a separate process. Part of
minilake, an independent demonstration system written only from this repository's write-up; not
the platform's code.

Writers append batches, each publish a new version. A rewriter meanwhile compacts one partition
again and again (a replace computed from the version it read). Readers pin the latest version and
read it whole, again and again.
  torn read     a read that fails its checksums, or sees a batch with rows missing or doubled
  lost commit   a batch whose publish returned but which the final version does not hold exactly
                once; a replace that rebased over a concurrent append would cause one
  crashed/hung  a process that exits with an error, or is still running at the deadline; either
                fails the run instead of stalling it
A version pinned before the processes start must read the same after they finish.
