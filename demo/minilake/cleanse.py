"""Layer 3 rules: label, flag or correct; remove only exact duplicates. Part of minilake, an
independent demonstration system written only from this repository's write-up; not the platform's
code.

Every rule's hits are counted per day. A correction never overwrites silently: each corrected cell
is entered in the day's correction log with the vendor's value. layer_diff() then holds cleansing to
what the rules name: undo every logged correction, and the cleansed rows must equal the typed rows
minus exact duplicates; every label, flag and correction must match its rule and its count.
