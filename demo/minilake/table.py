"""Versioned, typed, column-oriented tables. Part of minilake, an independent demonstration system
written only from this repository's write-up; not the platform's code.

Storage is a JSON file per partition holding one list per column: standard library only, so it runs
anywhere. It stands in for a columnar file format, and deliberately does not use the platform's stack.

A table is a folder of versions v000001, v000002, ... Each version folder holds the partition files
its publish wrote, plus a manifest listing every file the version contains (files first written by
earlier versions included), each with its partition, row count, symbols and SHA-256. Files are
never rewritten or deleted, so a version, once visible, never changes; a reader pins one by number.

Publishing is atomic, with optimistic concurrency in the style of the public Delta Lake and Apache
Iceberg table formats. A version is assembled in a staging folder and renamed into place in one
step, so a reader sees all of it or none of it. Two writers racing for the same number cannot both
win the rename. The loser re-checks against every version committed since its base:
  - an append commutes with anything, so it rebases onto the winner's manifest and takes the next
    number;
  - a replace was computed from its base. If a version since then wrote to a partition it replaces,
    rebasing would silently discard that commit, so it raises Conflict and the caller re-reads and
    retries. Otherwise it rebases like an append.
A replace cannot be issued without naming its base: replace() takes it as a required argument.
